Creating my own site has been on my to do list for years, YEARS! Everytime I had some time to spend time on it, I found myself researching technologies, and ultimately getting distracted on learning some other NEW thing.

Today, I was working on putting up a post in Seattle Ladies JS, and had to quickly get up to speed on Jekyll and github pages. Well, getting quickly up to speed was no problem! In the process I learned that  

1. Anyone with a github account can build a github pages site
2. You can blog with Jekyll, without a database!

Less than one hour later, I have a site up, and am making my first blog post. Hoo-ray. I'll cover how to get started in my next post.
